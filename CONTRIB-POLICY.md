If you're interested in contributing, please follow the guidelines below after having first read the [VTLL](LICENSE.md):

<hr>

- Before you start working on a feature or bug fix, please create an issue describing the problem or
  feature you intend to tackle. This way, we can discuss the best approach before you start coding.

- Once you've created an issue and discussed your proposed solution with the community, you're welcome to fork the repository and start working on your changes.

- Please make sure your code is adequately documented and adheres to the coding standards of the Library.

- By submitting a pull request, you agree to license your contribution under the terms and conditions of both the
  [VTLL](LICENSE.md) and the [Unity Companion License](https://unity.com/legal/licenses/unity-companion-license) (the "UCL").

- By contributing to the Library, including, but not limited to, providing code changes, bug fixes,
  or any other modifications, you agree that your contributions fall under the same copyrights and open-source
  nature of the Library. You grant the maintainers and other contributors the right to use, modify, and
  distribute your contributed code under the terms and conditions of both the [VTLL](LICENSE.md) and the [UCL](https://unity.com/legal/licenses/unity-companion-license).

- Do note that any contributions from users with inappropriate usernames or code, such as, but not limited to,
  item names of variables, classes, etcetera, and summaries, will be declined, no matter what, to keep the Library clean.

- These guidelines may be modified or updated; upon any such modification or update, you will comply with the guidelines
  of the updated VTCP when contributing to the Library under the updated VTCP guidelines.
