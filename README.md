# <ins>VectorTyping library</ins>
The VectorTyping code library contains custom-built Vector types based on those of the `UnityEngine` namespace, but with additional functionalities and is cross-compatible with those in the `UnityEngine` namespace.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License of the VectorTyping Library License (the "VTLL"). See the included [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details.

This C# code library was developed for licensed use with the Unity Engine and makes use of its namespaces, which are subject to the Unity Companion License (the "UCL").
By using this library, you also agree to be bound by the terms of the UCL, which can be found at: [https://unity.com/legal/licenses/unity-companion-license](https://unity.com/legal/licenses/unity-companion-license).


## Use of Unity references

The `VectorTyping` namespace uses references to namespaces provided by the Unity Engine, such as the `UnityEngine` namespace, for purposes
including, but not limited to, calculations and conversions between custom VectorTyping and built-in Unity data types, in compliance with
the Unity Reference-Only License (the "UROL"). <br/>
No modifications have been made to the engine's source code.

For more information about the UROL, please see their website at: [https://unity.com/legal/licenses/unity-reference-only-license](https://unity.com/legal/licenses/unity-reference-only-license).


## Unity Project Installation

Before using this library in any way, first read the library's terms and conditions in the [VTLL](LICENSE.md).

To add this C# code library to your Unity project, follow the steps below:

<blockquote>
  <b><i>1</i>.</b> Download the <samp>ZIP</samp> file containing this library's files.<br/>
  <p> </p>
  <b><i>2</i>.</b> Create a new folder in the <code>Assets</code> folder of your project and name it <code>VectorTyping</code>.<br/>
  <b><i>2b1</i>.</b> Optionally, you may also create a new folder in the <code>Assets</code> folder of your project to put custom assemblies into with a name to reflect that.<br/>
  <b><i>2b2</i>.</b> If so, put the newly created <code>VectorTyping</code> folder into that custom assemblies folder instead.<br/>
  <p> </p>
  <b><i>3</i>.</b> Then extract the <samp>ZIP</samp> file's contents to the directory of the newly created <code>VectorTyping</code> folder.<br/>
  <p> </p>
  <b><i>4</i>.</b> Open your project in Unity to get it to reload the project's Script Assemblies.<br/>
  <p> </p>
  <b><i>5</i>.</b> Lastly, make sure whatever IDE you're using recognizes it as within its own separate assembly and not with anything unrelated to the library in any way, as otherwise you risk the IDE mixing up your assemblies which could then lead to situations where you're not meant to access some code but can, all due to those assembly mix-ups.<br/>
</blockquote>

After following these steps, you should be able to use the `VectorTyping` namespace and its Vector types for your Unity project.
